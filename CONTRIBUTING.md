# Contributing guidelines

## Git flow

We're using git flow conventions as described in
[the blog post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) that founded Git Flow.

## Issues

First of all please check if your issue doesn't exists already on the tracker using the search tool.

Then follow the provided template.

### Feature requests

Please make sure the requested feature is inside the scope of this project.

## Pull requests

Please follow the provided template and make sure your code follows the [Code of conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## Code of conduct

Our code of conduct is based on GitHub Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct template.
 [You can read it here.](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Code style

We try to keep an open code style so here's the few mandatory things.

### Indentation

Make use of the **tab** character where possible (*Note: the YAML format do not allow tabs so this is the only allowed
 case to not use tabs*).

This is because most IDEs allow to configure the tab length. Recommended tab length is 4 spaces.

### Single quotes and double quotes

PHP language allows double quotes to evaluate PHP variables. We decided to discourage use of those quotes to enhance
 performance.

So please avoid using **double quotes** when not necessary.
